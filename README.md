generate readme file fo the given data with a section for trancsition detail   Basic Voting System - Simple yes/no voting with vote counting

Project Description
A decentralized voting system built on Ethereum that enables transparent, democratic decision-making through simple yes/no voting mechanisms. Users can create proposals, cast votes, and track results in a completely trustless and transparent environment. The system ensures fair voting by preventing double voting and maintaining a complete audit trail of all voting activities.
Project Vision
To democratize decision-making processes by providing a transparent, secure, and accessible voting platform where:

Every vote is recorded immutably on the blockchain
Results are calculated automatically and transparently
No central authority can manipulate voting outcomes
All participants have equal voting rights
Complete voting history is publicly verifiable

Our vision extends to becoming the foundation for decentralized governance systems, community decision-making, and organizational voting processes worldwide.

## üîÑ Transaction Details

The voting system interacts with Ethereum smart contracts. Each major action triggers a blockchain transaction. Here's a breakdown:

| Action              | Function              | Description                                       | Gas Cost (Est.) |
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| üìù Create Proposal   | `createProposal()`     | Deploys a new voting proposal to the blockchain   | ~100,000        |
| üó≥Ô∏è Vote             | `castVote()`          | Records a yes/no vote for a proposal              | ~50,000         |
| ‚èπÔ∏è End Proposal     | `endProposal()`       | Finalizes proposal and freezes voting             | ~40,000         |
| üìä Check Results     | `getProposalResults()` | View tally for a proposal                         | Free (read-only)|

> Note: Users must pay gas fees to interact with these functions. Votes and proposals are permanent once submitted.
